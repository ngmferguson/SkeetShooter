# SkeetShooter
Repo for the SkeetShooter code for my Machine Structures in C course

All of the code in main.c is code that I created originally or worked collaboratively with another student/TA to create.
Much of the code in the drivers folder is boilerplate which we recieved and "filled in gaps" to init the pins on our circuit boards.
f3d_lcd_sd contains several "drawCircle" or "fillCircle" functions which are of my creation.
I worked collaboratively with a long-term TA of the class to create very quick circle draw functions which could be called easily and efficiently.


# THE GAME:
The goal of SkeetShooter is to move your aiming reticle, and shoot the white discs which spawn at randomized locations on the screen.
